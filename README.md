# Russell Brooks
### Java Software engineer for Sprint/T-mobile for 12 years
### Java Dev at SAIC since 2024

Mostly learning projects here. A few coding challenges too. Just a place to save projects when I try out a new Technology or create something not for work.  Created this in late 2023 when I began a job search.
